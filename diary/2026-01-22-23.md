### [Migrating a large JavaScript web UI to TypeScript to improve developer experience](https://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/164790)

#### Summary

The article is about how to migrate a large JS web UI to Typescript and how that improve the developer experience. One intresting part is how the mood of the developers changed the code quality and the productivity. Even thought I dont focus on the migration part of the article, it is still intresting to read about the impact of the migration. We can see some of the advantages of the introduction of Typescript. The code written in Typescript have a consistent code structure and a better code understanding. It also increases the developer experience by adding som type of documentation using the types. It also benefits the usage of autocomplete and other tools that are available in the IDE.

### [An Empirical Investigation of the Effects of Type Systems and Code Completion on API Usability using TypeScript and JavaScript in MS Visual Studio](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2936313.2816720)

#### Summary

The article describes a comparison between 4 groups that got different tasks in TS or JS and with or without code completions. The result didnt show any significant differences between the groups. The authors said that the result should not be overinterpreted. It was a very controlled experiment. They dont descriibe the result or their conclustion in a good and clear way.

*I dont think we should lay any focus on this article.*

### [GENERATING TYPESCRIPT TYPES FROM OPENAPI SPECIFICATION FOR IMPROVED DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE](https://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/170636)

#### Summary

This article is from the same university as the first article. This article describes how important it is to know the types a developer is working with when they are working with an API. The author created a survey which developers answered on different questions about their experience with working with types and API documentation. The result showed thet the developers were more satisfied with when working with types that got autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification. We can see a big improvement in the developer experience when the types are autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification. However it was only a small group of developers that answered the survey. So we can really not draw any conclusions from this article on the validity of the result. However it is still intresting to see that the developer experience is improved when working with types.

### [JavaScript alternative (TypeScript) and its effectiveness in web development](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/795522)

#### Summary

This article is about the benefits of using Typescript instead of Javascript in general. It describes the benefits of using Typescript and how it can improve the code quality, maintainability, scalability and early error detection. It also includes a case study of typescript which includes different companies and their use of typescript. However im missing something with the case study or experiments that they did. It feels like they are just describing the benefits of using Typescript and not showing any actual data or experiments that prove the benefits of using Typescript. Overall it is a good article that describes the benefits and drawbacks of using Typescript.

*Could be good to use if we write about if schools should switch to teaching typescript instead of javascript. Overall it is a good article that describes the benefits and drawbacks of using Typescript.*

### [Modern front-end web development :­ how libraries and frameworks transform everything](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/342325)

### Summary

This article is about HTML, CSS and JavaScript vs libraries and frameworks.

*Not quite inline with what we want to write about.*

### [To type or not to type?: a systematic comparison of the software quality of JavaScript and typescript applications on GitHub](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524842.3528454)

### Summary

This article is about the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript. The experiment was to see the difference in software quality between JS and TS. In 4 cateories (5 with TS). Code smell, Cognitive complexity, Bug fix commits, Bug resolution time per language and how often the any type were used in TS. The result showed that TS had lower code smell per kLoC. It also showed that a TS developer had more bug fix commits and took almost a day longer to solve a bug. To test this they used projects on github (600). The result was that TS application led to higher code quality and better code understanding, when the type any was not/limited used. TS application were more bug prone and took longer to fix.

*Overall good article that shows the difference in software quality between JS and TS. This article is good if we want to write about how TS improves the code quality. With also naming the negative side.*

### [TypeScript: An Open-Source Programming Language with Options for Robust Development and Large-Scale Applications](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lnu.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10743426)

### Summary

This article describes what benefits TypeScript provides for the developer and the result of the written code. As many of the articles say TS provides better code quality, maintainability and scalability. However I cant really understand the method done by the author. Did he even run an experiment?

*Dont think we should use this article. Because of the lack of method and the result is not very convincing, based on the experiments.*

### [Do TypeScript Applications Show Better Software Quality than JavaScript Applications? A Repository Mining Study on GitHub](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/f73e742e-ed9c-4a66-8469-fcf54465871c/content)

### Summary

This article is about the effect on software quality when using TypeScript. This study was very similar to the article [To type or not to type?: a systematic comparison of the software quality of JavaScript and typescript applications on GitHub](https://dl-acm-org.proxy.lnu.se/doi/10.1145/3524842.3528454). They performed almost the identical experiment. The same result was shown. However this article was more detailed and overall better written. The result show that TypeScript applications showed better software quality than JavaScript applications.

*Overall good and very similar to the article [To type or not to type?: a systematic comparison of the software quality of JavaScript and typescript applications on GitHub](https://dl-acm-org.proxy.lnu.se/doi/10.1145/3524842.3528454). This article is good if we want to write about how TS improves the code quality.*
