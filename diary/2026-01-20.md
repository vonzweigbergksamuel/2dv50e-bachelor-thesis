What should our thesis be about? We're having a hard time coming up with something interesting, that we at the same time believe we can come to a conclusion about.

We've done some searching on google scholar about the following topics:

* SSR vs CSR
* Comparing rendering options in next.js
* Next.js prerendering strategies
* Load testing SSR vs CSR web applications
* Comparing loading strategies, loading spinner or skeleton, effect on user experience
